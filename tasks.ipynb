    "\n",
    "Bit shifting is a fundamental operation in computing that moves the bits of a binary number left or right, often used for fast arithmetic operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **left shift** (<<) moves bits to the left, filling the emptied positions with zeros. This effectively multiplies the number by powers of two (e.g., x << n is equivalent to x * 2^n). \n",
    "\n",
    "A **right shift** (>>) moves bits to the right and comes in two types: logical right shift, which fills the leftmost bits with zeros (used for unsigned numbers), and arithmetic right shift, which preserves the sign bit for signed numbers (keeping negative values negative). Right shifts effectively divide numbers by powers of two (e.g., x >> n is equivalent to x / 2^n).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circular Shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "A **circular shift** (also called a **bitwise rotation**) moves bits left or right, wrapping the overflowed bits around to the other end. Unlike regular shifts, which discard bits, circular shifts preserve all bits, making them useful in cryptography and low-level optimizations.\n",

    "- **Left Rotate (`ROTL`)**: Moves bits left, placing overflowed bits on the right.  \n",
